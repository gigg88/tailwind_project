        <p class="mb-2">Home to one of Norway’s oldest fishing villages, Træna’s year-round resident population has barely changed since the Stone Age, growing from around 250 people to just 500 today. These permanent residents live on the four main islands – Husøya, where the majority of people live, Selvær, Sanna, and Sandøy.
        </p>
        <p>The deep, cold waters that surround the archipelago are rich with different species of fish throughout the year. It’s long been known that Træna’s rocky islands, with their sheltered inlets, are the ideal base for fishing boats.
